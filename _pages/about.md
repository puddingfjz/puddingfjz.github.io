This is Jingzhi Fang, a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), under the supervision of Prof. Lei Chen.
Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from SHENYUAN Honors College at Beihang University (BUAA). 

I am interested in accelerating the inference efficiency of deep learning models through computation graph and operator optimization, resource allocation, etc. 
My current work focuses on improving the efficiency of large language models (LLMs).

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.)
