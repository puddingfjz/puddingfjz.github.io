This is Jingzhi Fang, a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), under the supervision of Prof. Lei Chen.
Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from SHENYUAN Honors College at Beihang University (BUAA). 

I am interested in accelerating the inference efficiency of deep learning models. My current work focuses on improving the efficiency of large language models (LLMs).

[^_^]: # (Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.)
